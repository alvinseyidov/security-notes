# Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap

This document represents a structured roadmap I follow while building
foundational and practical cybersecurity knowledge alongside backend development.

The focus is on understanding systems, networks, and web security
before moving to advanced or specialized areas.

---

## Phase 1: Core Fundamentals

### Networking
- IP addressing (IPv4 / IPv6)
- Ports and protocols
- TCP vs UDP
- Basic subnetting
- DNS, DHCP, NAT, routing
- HTTP vs HTTPS

Why:
Understanding how data moves across networks is essential for both attack and defense.

### Linux Fundamentals
- Command line basics
- File permissions and ownership
- Processes and system monitoring
- Networking commands
- Filesystem structure

Why:
Most servers and security tools operate on Linux systems.

### Security Mindset
- Identifying weak points
- Misconfiguration awareness
- Chaining small issues
- Thinking in terms of abuse cases

---

## Phase 2: Cryptography Essentials

- Hashing and password storage
- Encryption (symmetric & asymmetric)
- Encoding vs encryption
- HMAC
- Salting and key derivation
- TLS and certificates
- PKI fundamentals

Focus is on **practical usage**, not mathematical depth.

---

## Phase 3: Tools and Practical Skills

### Network & Traffic
- Network scanning
- Packet capture and analysis

### Web Security Tools
- Web proxy tools
- Vulnerability scanners
- Directory and endpoint discovery

### Password Security
- Hashing algorithms
- Password cracking concepts
- Defensive implications

---

## Phase 4: Web Security (OWASP Top 10)

- Injection flaws
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Data exposure risks
- XSS and CSRF
- Access control
- Security misconfiguration
- Dependency vulnerabilities

---

## Phase 5: Operating Systems & Hardening

- Linux internals
- Windows fundamentals
- Logging and monitoring
- Firewalls and access controls
- System hardening basics

---

## Phase 6: Detection and Monitoring (Blue Team)

- Log analysis
- SIEM concepts
- Incident response basics
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Introductory forensics

---

## Phase 7: Offensive Security (Ethical)

- Reconnaissance
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation concepts
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement

Practice in controlled lab environments only.

---

## Phase 8: Cloud Security

- Identity and access management
- Cloud networking basics
- Storage security
- Common cloud misconfigurations
- Monitoring and auditing

---

## Phase 9: Specialization Paths

- Application Security
- Cloud Security
- Security Engineering
- Blue Team / Detection
- Offensive Security

Specialization is chosen after building strong fundamentals.

---

## Phase 10: Certifications (Optional)

Certifications are considered as validation tools, not as learning substitutes.
